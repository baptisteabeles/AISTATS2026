\aistatstitle{Linear Bandits with Non-i.i.d. Noise}

\begin{abstract}
 We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.~assumption on the observation noise. 
As an alternative to this restrictive assumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but 
interdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this setting, we develop new confidence sequences 
using a recently introduced reduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive a bandit 
algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the 
resulting algorithm, expressed in terms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations. Among 
other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a factor of the mixing time for geometrically 
mixing observation noise.

\section*{Checklist}


% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist follows the references. For each question, choose your answer from the three possible options: Yes, No, Not Applicable.  You are encouraged to include a justification to your answer, either by referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline description (1-2 sentences). 
Please do not modify the questions.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page limit. Not including the checklist in the first submission won't result in desk rejection, although in such case we will ask you to upload it during the author response period and include it in camera ready (if accepted).

\textbf{In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.}
