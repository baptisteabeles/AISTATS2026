\aistatstitle{Linear Bandits with Non-i.i.d. Noise}

\begin{abstract}
 We study the linear stochastic bandit problem, relaxing the standard i.i.d.~assumption on the observation noise. 
As an alternative to this restrictive assumption, we allow the noise terms across rounds to be sub-Gaussian but 
interdependent, with dependencies that decay over time. To address this setting, we develop new confidence sequences 
using a recently introduced reduction scheme to sequential probability assignment, and use these to derive a bandit 
algorithm based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. We provide regret bounds for the 
resulting algorithm, expressed in terms of the decay rate of the strength of dependence between observations. Among 
other results, we show that our bounds recover the standard rates up to a factor of the mixing time for geometrically 
mixing observation noise.

\section*{Checklist}


% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
The checklist follows the references. For each question, choose your answer from the three possible options: Yes, No, Not Applicable.  You are encouraged to include a justification to your answer, either by referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline description (1-2 sentences). 
Please do not modify the questions.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page limit. Not including the checklist in the first submission won't result in desk rejection, although in such case we will ask you to upload it during the author response period and include it in camera ready (if accepted).

\textbf{In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.}
% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


\begin{enumerate}

  \item For all models and algorithms presented, check if you include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A clear description of the mathematical setting, assumptions, algorithm, and/or model. [Yes] We give a clear description in section \ref{sec:preliminaries} and \ref{sec:contrib}.
    \item An analysis of the properties and complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm. 
    [Not Applicable] 
    \item (Optional) Anonymized source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries. [Not Applicable]
  \end{enumerate}

  \item For any theoretical claim, check if you include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Statements of the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results. [Yes] See section \ref{sec:contrib}.
    \item Complete proofs of all theoretical results. [Yes] See specifically section \ref{sec:conf_sets} which contains all the tools we use for our analysis. We also provide more details in the Appendix.
    \item Clear explanations of any assumptions. [Yes] Our main technical assumption is clearly stated in section \ref{sec:contrib} and we discuss its interpretation to provide an intuition to the reader.   
  \end{enumerate}

  \item For all figures and tables that present empirical results, check if you include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL). [Not Applicable]
    \item All the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen). [Not Applicable]
    \item A clear definition of the specific measure or statistics and error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times). [Not Applicable]
    \item A description of the computing infrastructure used. (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider). [Not Applicable]
  \end{enumerate}

  \item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets, check if you include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Citations of the creator If your work uses existing assets. [Yes/No/Not Applicable]
    \item The license information of the assets, if applicable. [Not Applicable]
    \item New assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL, if applicable. [Not Applicable]
    \item Information about consent from data providers/curators. [Not Applicable]
    \item Discussion of sensible content if applicable, e.g., personally identifiable information or offensive content. [Not Applicable]
  \end{enumerate}

  \item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects, check if you include:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots. [Not Applicable]
    \item Descriptions of potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals if applicable. [Not Applicable]
    \item The estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation. [Not Applicable]
  \end{enumerate}
